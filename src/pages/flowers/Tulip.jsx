  How do you get seeds?
  <b>answer:</b>
Once the flower of a tulip plant dies off, you can extract the seeds from the pod to plant in the fall. If you allow the plant to go to seed after it blooms, the pod will eventually turn brown and crack open.

What is the duration of water a tulip?
<b>answer:</b>
After planting, water well, and once foliage appears they should be given a good watering every 7-10 days depending on how dry the weather is. During dry times of the year, be sure to water regularly, especially after the buds have appeared. It is ideal to keep bulbs relatively dry whilst dormant.
