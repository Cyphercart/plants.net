            <b>answer:</b> are characterized by producing tiny dust-like seeds with a small and undeveloped embryo not surrounded by an endosperm, which will only germinate and develop in the presence of symbiotic fungi (Arditti and Ghani, 2000; Rasmussen and Rasmussen, 2014).

            What is the duration of water a Orchid.
            <b>Answer:</b>You can also water your orchid like a traditional houseplant â€“ just apply a splash of water to the moss once every seven to 10 days. If the moss feels moist, you can wait a few days and check again before watering. Happily, orchids are surprisingly resilient when it comes to drying out when they're not in bloom.
