      <b>Plant description</b>

Their stems are usually prickly and their glossy, green leaves have toothed edges. Rose flowers vary in size and shape. They burst with colours ranging from pastel pink, peach, and cream, to vibrant yellow, orange, and red. Many roses are fragrant, and some produce berry-like fruits called hips.

            How to grow?
            <b>answer:</b> <q title='This is home process'>Start by digging a hole about twice as wide (but no deeper) than the rose's pot. Take the rosebush out of the container and loosen the roots. Spread roots out if they're growing in circles around the root ball. Place the roots in the hole and fill with soil, making sure to water well after you plant it.Nov 18, 2022</q>

               How do you get seed?
               <b>answer:</b>Use a knife to slice through the rose hip, remove the seeds and rinse off the pulp surrounding the seed. This pulp prevents sprouting. Store the seeds in a cool moist environment.

               What is the duration of water a rose?
               <b>answer:</b>Established roses – water every 2-3 days. Newly planted or roses planted in pots – water every day. As your rose starts blooming, take note if your flowers are wilting. This will happen in extreme heat but is a reliable sign that your roses need more water.
