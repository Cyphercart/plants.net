      <h2>Hydrangea Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Hydrangea (Hydrangea) is a popular garden flower, native to Eastern North America. These bushes or shrubs have medium-sized, rounded or oblong leaves. They produce small, clustered, star-shaped flowers in a variety of colors such as pink, blue, purple, or white.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Grow?</h3>
      <p>
        The Hydrangea prefers a moist but well-drained soil. Plant it in a location with full sun or partial shade, and maintain the soil by adding organic matter or fertilizer to keep the plant healthy. Keep the roots free from pests and diseases.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Propagate?</h3>
      <p>
        Hydrangea seeds are best sown indoors about 4 weeks before the last expected frost. This helps ensure that the seedlings will be well-established before they are exposed to cool temperatures. Plant the seeds 1 inch deep and 6 inches apart. Maintain optimal growing conditions and water them well when they are first seedlings.
      </p>

      <h3>Care and Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        To ensure a healthy Hydrangea, keep the following care instructions in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant it in a well-drained soil and provide proper irrigation.</li>
        <li>Feed it regularly with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the plant and remove any dead or diseased parts to promote healthy growth.</li>
        <li>Pruning is not necessary for hydrangeas, but removing dead flower heads will help maintain the bush's health.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Growing Period and Zone</h3>
      <p>
        Hydrangea flowers during late spring to early fall in their natural habitats. In gardens, they can bloom from late spring to late fall. This beautiful plant grows best in zones 4 to 9, where the temperatures are mild and there is little risk of frost.
