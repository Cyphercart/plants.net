      <h2>Azalea Flower Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Azalea is a stunning flowering shrub that graces gardens with its vibrant and abundant blooms. Native to Asia, Europe, and North America, Azaleas are known for their lush, green foliage and a wide array of flower colors, including shades of pink, red, white, and purple. These deciduous or evergreen shrubs are a favorite among garden enthusiasts for their ornamental beauty.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Grow?</h3>
      <p>
        Azaleas thrive in partial shade with well-drained, acidic soil. Plant them in a location with filtered sunlight and provide consistent moisture. Mulching around the base helps retain soil moisture and regulates temperature. Ensure proper air circulation to prevent diseases.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Propagate?</h3>
      <p>
        Propagate Azaleas through softwood cuttings in late spring or early summer. Choose healthy, non-flowering shoots and plant them in a mixture of peat moss and perlite. Keep the soil consistently moist until roots develop, and then transplant the rooted cuttings to their permanent location.
      </p>

      <h3>Care and Maintenance</h3>

        <li>Water consistently to maintain soil moisture, especially during dry periods.</li>
        <li>Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in spring to support growth and flowering.</li>
        <li>Prune after flowering to shape the shrub and remove dead or damaged branches.</li>
        <li>Protect Azaleas from extreme temperatures, particularly frost, which can damage buds.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Growing Period and Zone</h3>
