      <h2>Iris Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Iris is a genus of flowering plants in the subfamily Irioideae of the family Iridaceae. The common name "iris" refers to various flowering plants in different genera that share similar qualities, such as bright, strikingly patterned petals, a pungent odor, and an interesting color variation among individual petals.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Grow?</h3>
      <p>
        Irises grow best in well-drained, sunny sites. Plant them 8 to 12 inches apart and allow the roots to develop in the same position where they were originally planted. Once established, provide regular watering, but avoid overwatering.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Propagate?</h3>
      <p>
        Irises can be propagated by seed or by dividing the bulbs. Seed can be planted directly into the ground, but it's recommended to let the seed germinate indoors for a few weeks before planting it outdoors. Dividing the bulbs is also a good method for propagation, as long as you ensure that you separate the parent bulb evenly to avoid weakening it.
      </p>

      <h3>Care and Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        To maintain a healthy Iris, keep the following care instructions in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide proper spacing between plants and ensure good drainage.</li>
        <li>Apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season.</li>
        <li>Avoid overwatering, as it can lead to root rot.</li>
        <li>Irises can become victim to pests like aphids and thrips. Keep an eye on your plants and apply any necessary pest control measures.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Growing Period and Zone</h3>
      <p>
        Irises bloom in various periods, depending on the specific species. In general, they flower between spring and early summer. The hardiness of irises varies depending on the species, but they can generally survive in zones 4 to 9, with the most cold-hardy species capable of surviving in zones 3 and even 2.
