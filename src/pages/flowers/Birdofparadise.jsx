      <h2>Bird of Paradise Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Bird of Paradise (Strelitzia) is a popular garden flower, native to South Africa. These tall perennials grow in the shape of umbrellas and have feathery leaves that grow upwards from the central stalk. They produce brightly colored flowers in summer and autumn, attracting birds and butterflies.

      <h3>How to Grow?</h3>
      <p>
        The Bird of Paradise needs full sunlight to grow. Plant it in well-drained soil in a sheltered spot to protect it from wind. Provide it with a moderate watering once the plant has established. Water it thoroughly when the soil is dry to the touch, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.

      <h3>How to Propagate?</h3>
      <p>
        Bird of Paradise seeds are best sown indoors about 4 weeks before the last expected frost. This helps ensure that the seedlings will be well-established before they are exposed to cool temperatures. Plant the seeds 1 inch deep and 6 inches apart. Maintain optimal growing conditions and water them well when they are first seedlings.
