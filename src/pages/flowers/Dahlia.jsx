            How to grow?
            <b>answer:</b> <q title='This is home process'>Dahlias require a fertile, moist but well-drained soil, and a sunny, sheltered spot. The taller varieties need staking. In autumn, dig up the tubers and overwinter them in a frost-free place, such as a greenhouse or a shed. Bring them back into growth in early April, then plant out in the garden from May onwards.</q>

               How do you get seed?
               <b>answer:</b>Dahlia seed can be harvested in the fall after old blooms dry up and seeds are created inside the old blooms. It is best to leave blooms on your plant for about a month prior to frost and then harvest the seed pods (dried up blooms) after frost, allowing them time to fully develop.

               What is the duration of water a Dahlia?
               <b>answer:</b>Young dahlia plants do not require much water. Once your dahlia plants are established (8-12” tall), water regularly and deeply. A good rule of thumb is that your dahlias should receive 1” of water every week. In the heat of summer, dahlias will require more water especially if it is warm and dry.
