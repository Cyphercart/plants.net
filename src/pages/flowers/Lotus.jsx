      After planting, water well, and once foliage appears they should be given a good watering every 7-10 days depending on how dry the weather is. During dry times of the year, be sure to water regularly, especially after the buds have appeared. It is ideal to keep bulbs relatively dry whilst dormant.

         What is the duration of water a lotus?
         <b>answer:</b>
         Lotuses are day-blooming plants, opening early in the morning and closing by mid-afternoon. They completely close up at night. This bloom pattern continues throughout their lifespan, which is typically 3 to 5 days. On the third day, the petals begin to fall, leaving behind their seedpod.
