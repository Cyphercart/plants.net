      <h2>Sunflower Description</h2>
      <p>
        The Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a popular garden flower, native to North America. These tall annuals grow in the shape of umbrellas and have feathery leaves that grow upwards from the central stalk. They produce brightly colored flowers in summer and autumn, attracting birds and butterflies.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Grow?</h3>
      <p>
        The Sunflower needs full sunlight to grow. Plant it in well-drained soil in a sunny spot to promote maximum growth. Provide it with a moderate watering once the plant has established. Water it thoroughly when the soil is dry to the touch, but avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Propagate?</h3>
      <p>
        Sunflower seeds are best sown indoors about 4 weeks before the last expected frost. This helps ensure that the seedlings will be well-established before they are exposed to cool temperatures. Plant the seeds 1 inch deep and 6 inches apart. Maintain optimal growing conditions and water them well when they are first seedlings.
      </p>

      <h3>Care and Maintenance</h3>
      <p>
        To ensure a healthy Sunflower, keep the following care instructions in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant it in a well-drained soil and avoid overwatering.</li>
        <li>Feed it regularly with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer during the growing season.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the plant and remove any dead or diseased parts to promote healthy growth.</li>
        <li>If necessary, cut the flowers off to prevent them from becoming brittle.</li>
        <li>To promote better air circulation, prune the leaves every 2 years.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Growing Period and Zone</h3>
      <p>
        Sunflower flowers during summer and autumn in their natural habitats. In gardens, they can bloom from late spring to early autumn. This beautiful plant grows best in zones 5 to 10, where the temperatures are mild and there is little risk of frost.
