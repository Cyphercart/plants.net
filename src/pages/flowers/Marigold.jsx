            How to grow?
            <b>answer:</b> <q title='This is home process'>Marigolds are not fussy. Any good garden soil (and a little water during dry spells) should keep them happy, as long as the soil is not too acidic. Keep the soil pH roughly neutral, from 6.0 to 7.0 . They also don't need a soil that is particularly rich in organic matter and seem to grow better in a leaner soil.</q>

               How do you get seed?
               <b>answer:</b>Marigolds are super easy to grow from seed. They have good germination rates, and the seeds are long, which makes them easier to handle. Since they're sensitive to cold and will be damaged or killed by frost, wait until all threat of frost has passed before you sow your marigold seeds outdoors.

               <b>answer:</b>Marigolds need moist soil for the first week or two after planting to establish a strong root system. Once established, they require watering around once per week and more often in summer when temperatures are high.
